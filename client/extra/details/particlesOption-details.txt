1. Background
Purpose: Sets the background color of the particle animation area.
Usage:
color: Defines the color of the background.
How to Modify: Change the value to any color you want. For example, value: '#ff0000' will set the background color to red.
2. FPS Limit
Purpose: Controls how many frames per second the animation runs at, which helps with performance.
Usage:
fpsLimit: Specifies the maximum number of frames per second.
How to Modify: Adjust the number to fit your needs. Higher values mean smoother animations but may affect performance. For example, fpsLimit: 60 for standard smoothness.
3. Interactivity
Purpose: Configures how the particles react to user actions like clicking and hovering.
Usage:
events: Contains settings for interactive behaviors.
onClick: Controls what happens when the user clicks on the particle area.
enable: Set to true to activate the click behavior.
mode: Defines the action taken on click, such as push to add more particles.
onHover: Controls what happens when the user hovers over the particle area.
enable: Set to true to activate hover behavior.
mode: Defines the action on hover, such as repulse to push particles away.
resize: Set to true to adjust particles when the window size changes.
How to Modify: Change the mode values to different behaviors or toggle enable to false to disable specific interactions.
4. Particles
Purpose: Customizes the appearance and behavior of the particles themselves.
Usage:
color: Sets the color of the particles.
links: Configures the lines connecting particles.
color: Sets the color of these lines.
distance: Defines how far apart particles can be linked.
enable: Set to true to show lines between particles.
opacity: Controls the transparency of the lines.
width: Adjusts the thickness of the lines.
collisions: Determines if particles can collide with each other.
enable: Set to true to allow collisions.
move: Controls how particles move.
direction: Can be none (random movement) or other directions.
enable: Set to true to make particles move.
outModes: Determines what happens when particles hit the edge of the container. For example, bounce makes them bounce back.
random: Set to false for consistent movement, true for random.
speed: Controls how fast the particles move.
straight: Set to false for random movement, true for straight paths.
number: Adjusts the number of particles and their density.
density: Controls the density calculation area.
value: Total number of particles to display.
opacity: Controls how transparent the particles are.
shape: Defines the shape of the particles, like circle or square.
size: Adjusts the size range of the particles.
How to Modify:
color: Change to any color you prefer.
links: Modify distance, color, and width for different link styles.
collisions: Toggle enable to allow or disallow collisions.
move: Adjust speed, direction, and outModes to control movement styles.
number: Change value to increase or decrease the number of particles.
opacity: Set to any value between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).
shape: Change type to other shapes if needed.
size: Set value to a specific size or range.
5. Detect Retina
Purpose: Ensures that particles look good on high-resolution (retina) screens.
Usage:
detectRetina: Set to true to support high-resolution displays.
How to Modify: Generally, leave this as true to ensure your animation looks sharp on all screens.
Summary
background: Changes the background color.
fpsLimit: Sets the maximum frame rate.
interactivity: Configures how particles respond to clicks and hovers.
particles: Customizes the particles' appearance, movement, and behavior.
detectRetina: Ensures good display quality on high-resolution screens.
